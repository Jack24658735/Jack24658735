## üí¨ Introduction
Currently, I‚Äôm a graduate student pursuing my M.S. degree in the Communication Engineering Dept at NTU. I'm advised by [Yu‚ÄëChiang Frank Wang](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/ycwang.html) at [Vision and Learning Lab](http://vllab.ee.ntu.edu.tw/). My research primarily revolves around multiple CV domains, including but not limited to Federated Learning, 3D generation, Self-supervised Learning, Transfer Learning, Vision & Language, etc. Through my dedication and continuous exploration, I aim to contribute to the advancement of Computer Vision while expanding my knowledge and expertise in this exciting field. Also, I'm skilled at developing problem-solving methods for different challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools if demands arise.

Previously, I was an intern at **Synopsys** (until *Jun.2022*), developing and studying AI compilers and AI accelerators. I have completed my B.S. degree at NTHU, majoring in Electrical Engineering (EE) with an undergraduate project in Computer Vision as advised by [Min-Sun](https://aliensunmin.github.io/).
